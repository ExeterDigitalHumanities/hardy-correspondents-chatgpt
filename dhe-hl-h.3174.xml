                Florence Henniker writes from Shoreham to congratulate Thomas Hardy
                on his Cambridge fellowship, comment on dramatic and poetic
                adaptations of his work, discuss contemporary poetry readings, and
                share news of mutual acquaintances.

                Florence Ellen Hungerford Henniker (1855–1923), novelist and short
                story writer, was a close friend and sometimes collaborator of
                Thomas Hardy. This letter, written from her home “The Little Orchard”
                at Shoreham, Kent, comments on stage and poetic responses to Hardy’s
                work and reflects their long literary friendship.

            <p>
                How nice of you to write to me from <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2653941/">Cambridge</placeName>!
                and thank you too for telling me that you are pleased to have this link
                with Arthur in belonging to his old college. Magdalene must be proud
                to have you as a Fellow. I hope it may be cheering to you, &amp; a real
                interest to go there from time to time.
            </p>
            
            <seg type="crosswriting">
                many more stories in your new book; some day I must talk to you about
                them.

            <p>
                I see in to-day’s "<hi>D[aily] Mail</hi>" an account of the
                "<hi>Woodlanders</hi>" &amp; a picture of Marty South. It will be
                interesting to hear how far you — I, for perhaps you saw the
                rehearsals, at any rate — &amp; Miss Drysdale, think she came at near
                to your conception of the character? It is rather wonderful if an
                untrained actress succeeded in satisfying people who care for the book.
                I daresay Miss D. will kindly write &amp; tell me about it.

            <seg type="crosswriting">
                I thought the "Tryst at the ancient earthwork" extremely good — such a
                difficult thing to do!  "The Wedding Supper", "The Grave by the
                Hand-post", &amp; "A Mere Interlude" are very characteristic of you —
                including that dramatic situation of the honeymoon in the letter — the
                Committee’s "Moon of Three Terrors" is very original &amp; I so admire
                that last paragraph "that outline against the stars of the morning" —
                so graphic!  "Alveira Dian" <unclear>interested me</unclear>, but in some
                ways it is unlike you, I think?

                I am going to send you a very small vol. of really charming poems by
                Miss Wedmore. I think "<hi>England</hi>" &amp; "<hi>The Grand Duke’s
                    Funeral</hi>" especially good. I hope she will have the praise she
                deserves from some of the critics. Sir F. Wedmore gave a
                <unclear>great deal of encouragement</unclear> to people who care for
                true poetry.

            <p>
                I hope you are feeling better, &amp; that vein in your leg does not now
                give trouble?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This place seems to suit me, &amp; I am doing a good deal in the
                garden &amp; hope to encourage many birds to make it their home.
                We had a very interesting poetry reading the other evening in
                <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2638053/">Sevenoaks</placeName>.
                He read your "<hi>Burgh</hi>" &amp; "<hi>The Rash Bride</hi>" (the
                latter particularly well). I thought also a beautiful little poem
                "<hi>Twilight</hi>", by Masefield, which I am sure wd. appeal to you,
                &amp; a lovely little lyric "<hi>Jenny’s Daughter</hi>", by Mona
                O’Neill — intensely pathetic in its simplicity. Do you know it? I
                wonder if you are writing more verse now? I have read a great
                <unclear>deal with admiration</unclear>.
