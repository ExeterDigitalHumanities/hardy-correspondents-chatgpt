                Florence Henniker thanks Hardy for his letter and a poem in the Sphere,
                comments on contemporary verse and war poetry, reflects on cinema and
                performing animals, notes recent animal-protection measures, and
                describes rural life and birds in her orchard at Shoreham.

                Florence Henniker (1855–1923), novelist and close friend of Thomas Hardy,

                the First World War, discussing literature, animal welfare, and her

            <p>
                Best thanks for your last nice long letter, full of news. Also very many
                thanks for the fine poem in the "<hi>Sphere</hi>". There are beautiful
                lines in it, but of course it is very sad. I have not seen the magazine
                conducted by the "uppish" young poets. Possibly there may be good
                things in it now &amp; again, for as Mr. <unclear>Gosse</unclear> thinks
                there is a great deal of almost good verse published. I think Miss
                Wedmore’s is very much above the ordinary, don’t you? and I see that a
                story by Mr. Arthur Bell is very much praised.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I was really impressed by Frank <unclear>Tayfin’s</unclear>
                "<hi>The Gallant Way</hi>". They are of course soldiers’ poems, &amp;
                they have a splendid ring &amp; go about them — one on "Minden" —
                another on "Blucher" — &amp; a 3rd about "The Men" <unclear>themselves</unclear>.

                I think Miss Wedmore’s verse much above the ordinary; don’t you? and I
                see that a story by Mr Arthur Bell is very much praised. I was really
                impressed by Frank <unclear>Taplin’s</unclear> "<hi>The Gallant Way</hi>".
                They are of course soldiers’ poems &amp; they have a splendid ring &amp;

                There are a few things that have happened lately which cheer one. The
                passing of the plumage bill in America &amp; the stopping of the
                feathers from the hats of certain women delights me. But I fear the
                inspection of the ponies is very unsatisfactory — &amp; Mr. McKenna
                has behaved badly about it. I hope you are getting fond of this live
                "Wessex"?

                This place, as I think I told you, is quite astonishingly rural. In some
                of the country roads &amp; lanes one might be a hundred miles from
                <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743/">London</placeName>,
                instead of 23.

                What do you think of this craze for films? I see you say "Far from the
                madding crowd" is to be done. I wonder if the system makes people lazy
                about reading, &amp; less keen about genuine drama?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am so glad you have written about performing animals. There may be a
                few cases in which they are kindly treated, &amp; learn tricks easily
                (such as Milner’s); but the whole thing is liable to dreadful abuses &amp;
                cruelties.

                There are a few birds that have already taken to us, which cheers one.
                The plumage bill in America, &amp; the stopping of the feathers from
                the hats of certain women, delights me, as I said. I hope you are
                feeling fairly well.

            <p>
                I hope to do a great deal in encouraging birds in the orchard. Please
                give many messages to Miss Drysdale, &amp; my love. Some day you &amp;
                she must come &amp; see me here.

                The other day I went to a little party at the boys’ — the two
                <unclear>Sergeants</unclear> that first had them; they were so kind in
                getting up interesting talk to come &amp; talk to me of it.

                you of it another time.
