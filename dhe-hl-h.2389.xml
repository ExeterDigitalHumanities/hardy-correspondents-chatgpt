            <salute>Dear <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/49245702">Thomas Hardy</persName>,</salute>

         <p>Many times I have written to you — each time sensible of the liberty I was taking in intruding upon you, destroying my letter. For twenty years you have been a part of our life and through your thought and work we have often found something that made us, even in our most anxious moments, live and try anew.<lb/>
            Only this week we have been re-reading a book of yours — for perhaps the twentieth time.<lb/>
            For a long time I could not forgive you for <hi>Jude the Obscure</hi> but now I would not have him out of the book if I could. He had to be.<lb/>
            My lover — we have been with one another over twenty years — I think first read one of your books to me — the great <hi>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</hi> — and then we read <hi>The Mayor of Casterbridge</hi>. And then re-read them both. And so it has been ever since — reading and re-reading your many books.<lb/></p>
         
         <pb facs="uoedh_hl_h.2389_2.jpg"/>
         <p>Just now I was reading aloud some of your poems, lingering especially over “Shelley’s Skylark”, “The Phantom Horsewoman”, “Departure”, “The Dead”, “George Meredith”, “In a Wood”, “To an Unborn Pauper Child” — indeed lingering over them all. Thrilled by the superb closing lines of the volume:<lb/>
            <q>But — a stirring thrills the air<lb/>
               Like to sounds of joyance there,<lb/>
               That the rages of the ages<lb/>
               Shall be cancelled,<lb/>
               And deliverance offered<lb/>
               From the darts that were.<lb/>
               Consciousness the will informing,<lb/>
               Till it fashion all things fair.</q><lb/>
            I simply had to come in &amp; tell you of our love and reverence.<lb/></p>
         
         <pb facs="uoedh_hl_h.2389_3.jpg"/>
         <p>A short time ago I became quite angry concerning you while reading again <hi>A Group of Noble Dames</hi>: “He detests women — he is most unjust to them,” I ranted. But very soon afterwards I retracted — “He understands them too well — &amp; his Tess is the tortured upholder of that earthly-obscured ideal of chastity which has always been humanity’s star.”<lb/></p>

         <p><persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/61295254">Richard Robert Frank Hill</persName> is the name of the editor of this magazine &amp; the lover who loves me &amp; whom I love. <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/80391286">Marie O’Sullivan</persName> is the third in our Hardy reading circle. We all send you our deep respect and regard and we say as a prayer, “God bless you, guard you, uplift you &amp; hold you in His love.”<lb/></p>
