                    <salute>
                        <lb/>Dear Sir,
                    </salute>
                </opener>
                
                <p>
                    <lb/>I am sorry that I shall not be able to expect a story from
                    <lb/>you at an earlier date. I do not however mean
                    <lb/>to fix any particular time, as we are generally going
                    <lb/>to remain away four months.
                    <lb/>At present I may say that we shall probably have room
                    <lb/>for a new story somewhere about October or November
                    <lb/>next. I expect a new story to begin in January to
                    <lb/>last till about that time. If that should
                    <lb/>be too early for you, there will probably be one
                    <lb/>a few months later.
                    <lb/>If you would give me a call when you come to town
                    <lb/>I should be very glad to see you to talk about
                    <lb/>our future arrangements which will probably be clearer by
                    <lb/>that time than they now are.
                    <lb/>Meanwhile I should extremely be anxious to have the
                    <lb/>refusal of your play if you can give it me. From
                    <lb/>what you say, I think it would suit us very well.
                </p>
                
                <pb n="2" facs="uoedh_hl_h.5498_2.jpg"/>
                
                <p>
                    <lb/>I may however say that I think that I could, if you desired
                    <lb/>it, make an arrangement to that effect, viz. that you
                    <lb/>should write the story with a view to the <hi>The Cornhill</hi>, but
                    <lb/>that Messrs <persName ref="">Smith &amp; Elder</persName> should understand that if they
                    <lb/>did not use it for that purpose, they should publish
                    <lb/>it independently. I suggest this in order that you
                    <lb/>might not be going out of your way by writing
                    <lb/>expressly for us, with any doubt as to your story
                    <lb/>being then possibly thrown away.
                    <lb/>I do not think, however, from what you say, that such an
                    <lb/>arrangement would be necessary, as I fancy that your
                    <lb/>novel would most likely suit us independently of
                    <lb/>any special intention as to its ultimate destination.
                    <lb/>I may add that I should not think it at all necessary to
                    <lb/>have the whole story written in advance, unless that
                    <lb/>mode of publishing was more convenient to you. Of
                    <lb/>course it is more convenient to be in possession of
                    <lb/>the whole Ms; but most authors are in the habit
                    <lb/>of publishing the first part before having come to the
                    <lb/>end.
                    <lb/>My present address is as above. I shall be changing my house in
                    <lb/>the spring; but a note to <persName ref="">Smith, Elder</persName>, 15
                    <lb/><placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743">Waterloo Place</placeName>, <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743">London</placeName>
                    <lb/>will always find me in a day or two.
                </p>
                
                <closer>
                    <p>
