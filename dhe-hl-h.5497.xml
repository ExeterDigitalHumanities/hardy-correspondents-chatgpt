                <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            
            <p>
                I hear from Mr. Mould that I may address you as the author of
                "<hi>Under the Greenwood Tree</hi>".<lb/>
                I have lately read &amp; <unclear>shewn</unclear> this with very great pleasure indeed.<lb/>
                I think the descriptions of country life admirable &amp; indeed it is long since I have received more pleasure
                from a new writer.<lb/>
                It also occurred to me, and it is for this reason that I take the liberty of addressing you,<lb/>
                that such writing would probably please the readers of <hi>The Cornhill Magazine</hi> as much as it has pleased me.<lb/>
                "<hi>Under the Greenwood Tree</hi>" is of course not a magazine story. There is too little incident for such purpose:
                for, though I do not want a murder in every number, it is necessary to catch the attention of readers by some distinct &amp;
                well arranged plot.<lb/>
                If you are so I hope working anything novel I should be very glad to have the offer of it for our pages.<lb/>
                I of course cannot say anything more definite at present; but I should be very glad to hear from you whether there is any
                probability of my receiving such an offer.<lb/>
                If I can give you any further information on the subject, of course I shall be very happy to do so.<lb/>
                I will only say now that if any agreement could be made between us I have no doubt it would be satisfactorily carried out on both sides.<lb/>
                Meanwhile,<lb/>
            </p>
