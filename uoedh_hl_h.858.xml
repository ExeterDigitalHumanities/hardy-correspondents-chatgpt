               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            
            <p>
               First of all I ask you to excuse me<lb/>
               for the liberty I take in writing to you.<lb/>
               Today is beautiful, although the atmo-<lb/>
               sphere is anything but pleasant.<lb/>
               Illumination pours down its warm pure<lb/>
               rays, speaking to everything in this<lb/>
               beautiful old world. I am just an<lb/>
               ordinary young working man, though<lb/>
               not one of the most fortunate in life,<lb/>
               yet I possess riches untold, and beyond<lb/>
               price,—it is not the ordinary wealth,<lb/>
               or jewels: it is something far, far<lb/>
               more precious; it is the love of all<lb/>
               that is beautiful in the world of<lb/>
               literature and the Classsic arts.<lb/>
               Often after a long day in the work-<lb/>
               shop, the head splitting, riveting,<lb/>
               the hammering, the thuds of the cranks,<lb/>
               the whirr and hum, and rattle of<lb/>
               various types of machinery, relieved<lb/>
               by the snatch of a whistling, humming,<lb/>
               or singing of a popular air; by snatches<lb/>
               we manage to catch<lb/>
               those whiffs of the outside world per-
            </p>
            
            <pb n="2" facs="#h858_s2"/>
            
            <p>
               colating defiantly the noise. How they per-<lb/>
               spire, the path of the perspiration, making<lb/>
               perpendicular lines down the face and neck<lb/>
               almost resembling the tattoo designs one is<lb/>
               familiar with in the illustrations of the<lb/>
               few surviving Maoris. It is the blood<lb/>
               message of toil, away home, tea, to<lb/>
               tired to leave the cottage, so after read-<lb/>
               ing a portion of the newspaper to my angel<lb/>
               mother, who is not able to read, away to<lb/>
               the solitude of my bedroom to indulge<lb/>
               in one of the treats of my life—the book.<lb/>
               My affected imagination soon transports<lb/>
               me to the land of romance, the scenes,<lb/>
               or the flowery dells. I borrow books now,<lb/>
               —times have been so bad, I have<lb/>
               been obliged to sell much of my book<lb/>
               collection. Your books have brought to me un-<lb/>
               told delight; now I am wanting to borrow<lb/>
               the latest publication of some of your<lb/>
               poems &amp;c. &amp;c. You see I enclose a stamped<lb/>
               addressed envelope. I wish to know if<lb/>
               you will kindly favour me by sending me<lb/>
               your autograph. It will be a great treasure<lb/>
               from an author who to me has been a<lb/>
               source of encouragement, helping to take off<lb/>
               a share of the roughnesses of life. My kindest<lb/>
               thoughts and good wishes to you. God Bless You.<lb/>
               I Remain,<lb/>
               Yours Sincerely,<lb/>
