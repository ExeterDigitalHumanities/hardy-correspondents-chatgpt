                        <lb/>Dear <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/54148778">Thomas Hardy</persName>,

                <p>
                    <lb/>Why did you write "<title>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</title>"?
                    <lb/>I wake up at night,
                    <lb/>screaming against the injustices of it,
                    <lb/>and I cannot rid it from my
                    <lb/>thoughts. It is the most haunting tragedy
                    <lb/>I have ever experienced.
                    <lb/>Is it necessary to add sorrow
                    <lb/>to an already overburdened world, even in
                    <lb/>the form of a novel? Or perhaps you
                    <lb/>have known a person or persons, who
                    <lb/>have undergone these experiences, and
                    <lb/>you wished to proclaim the injustices
                    <lb/>that had been done to them.
                    <lb/>Is it the fate of some people to
                    <lb/>go through life, utterly alone although
                    <lb/>longing and yearning for true
                </p>
                
                <!-- Page 2 (text image 3) -->

                <p>
                    <lb/>companionship and never finding
                    <lb/>it? Then suppose there is no life after
                    <lb/>death? Where does justice come in?
                    <lb/>Where are the long years of loneliness
                    <lb/>and unrelieved pain, and impositions
                    <lb/>upon innocence and helplessness
                    <lb/>made up for?
                    <lb/>What hope is there for Tess, or Clare,
                    <lb/>or even d’Urberville or those who have
                    <lb/>suffered as they? Telling about it may
                    <lb/>prevent others from falling into
                    <lb/>snares of folly and ignorance and
                    <lb/>misunderstanding, but little good
                    <lb/>will the telling of it do Tess in
                    <lb/>finding what she sought for in vain.
                    <lb/>And only the exquisite touch of
                    <lb/><unclear>by giving them</unclear>
                    <lb/>torturing her and Clare both the
                    <lb/>happiness they sought when it was too
                    <lb/>late for them to hold it? What
                </p>
                
                <!-- Page 3 (text image 2, numbered "2.") -->

                <p>
                    <lb/>is behind the Fate that controls these
                    <lb/>things? What is the ultimate answer?
                    <lb/>You as an artist and can see into
                    <lb/>the depths of sorrow and feel it, and
                    <lb/>can also describe what you see and feel.
                    <lb/>What about those who are not artists, or
                    <lb/>only half–artists, and who also
                    <lb/>see &amp; feel sorrow as clearly as you, but
                    <lb/>have not the gift of having a voice in
                    <lb/>protest? They can only suffer and
                    <lb/>say nothing. What hope do you offer
                    <lb/>them, or do you offer them any?
                    <lb/>What is there to live for? Must
                    <lb/>we accept an inevitable Fate, which
                    <lb/>doles happiness to some and sorrow to
                    <lb/>others? Have you any vision of what
                    <lb/>lies behind it all or beyond?
                    <lb/>You are old, and I am young, and
                </p>
                
                <!-- Page 4 -->
                <pb n="4" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4611_4.jpg"/>
                
                <p>
                    <lb/>you have plumbed the depths of
                    <lb/>men’s hearts. Can you not give me
                    <lb/>a notion of what the answers to my
                    <lb/>questions are, before you come to the
                    <lb/>place where you know the true answers,
                    <lb/>but cannot tell them? My life
                    <lb/>should be happy, considering its
                    <lb/>circumstances, but sometimes I
                    <lb/>feel as if an awful chasm were
                    <lb/>opening at my feet, and there below
                    <lb/>only cries of unrequited pain,
                    <lb/>unredeemed injustices are heard.
                    <lb/>It seems that the only life left after
                    <lb/>death were sorrow.
                    <lb/>There are some who would say
                    <lb/>that all pain was not as bad as it
                    <lb/>seems. But I cannot make fine
                    <lb/>distinctions. The tragical facts of life
                    <lb/>are facts, and the fund of human
                </p>
                
                <!-- Page 5 -->
                <pb n="5" facs="uoedh_hl_h.4611_5.jpg"/>
                
                <p>
                    <lb/>happiness will not be increased
                    <lb/>until these facts are altered. In the
                    <lb/>meantime—what? And will
                    <lb/>they ever be altered? People do
                    <lb/>commit irremediable folly, and do
                    <lb/>die in hopelessness, even as Tess died.
                    <lb/>Every day appalling injustice is done,
                    <lb/>which is not ameliorated in any degree
                    <lb/>by the fact that justice and mercy
                    <lb/>are also sometimes done. What of
                    <lb/>those whose lives have been ruined?
                    <lb/>Why is pain? Why is injustice?
                    <lb/>Are they fundamental and ultimate
                    <lb/>defects in the scheme of things, that
                    <lb/>will never be altered, but must be borne?
                    <lb/>If this is an answer, then it were better
                    <lb/>not to live, if by dying we could
                    <lb/>escape these defects.

                        <lb/>These questions sometimes almost

                        <lb/>bring an answer.
                        <lb/>I wrote this in the hope that
