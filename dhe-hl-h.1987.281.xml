         <p>My dear May,<lb/>
            I suppose you are very glad that Xmas is coming.<lb/>
            Do not send back the Sat. Night books — take care of them and put them in your box, so that I may have them when I want them.<lb/>
            I wish you wd. tell me how u.r. when u. write. I have a <del>cold</del> “cowld in by head,” so I have staid in all day to be all right to morrow.<lb/>
            Last Friday night there was a conversazione (pronounced “kon-ver-sat-zio-ne”) at the Architectural Association’s rooms. There were about 300, or 400 present, including your humble servant. <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/51747985">Mr. Blomfield</persName>, one of the Committee, gave me a ticket, and <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/unknown">Mr. Bunker</persName>, another Committee man, another, etc. I gave to Shaw and we went together. After lots of speeches (fying from learned professors), there was music &amp;c, and coffee — this last rather in small quantities. Many ladies were there, and of course in full dress. Shaw lent me a dress coat (his), as I did not possess one. My name was proposed among many others, for becoming a member.</p>

         <p>Miss A. and Father went off all right, as you hear.<lb/>
            Do you ever write to Eliza? Father enjoyed himself, though. I took them to hear the Opera of <hi>Guillaume Tell</hi> at <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743">Covent Garden</placeName>, but nothing would satisfy Father unless he went to see the <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643744">Thames Tunnel</placeName>. This, you know, is 5 or 6 miles from <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2645619">Kilburn</placeName>, and lies in one of the lowest and most crowded parts of <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743">London</placeName>. Accordingly, one morning he started off alone, agreeing to meet Miss A. at the foot of the Monument on <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643364">Tower Hill</placeName> at 1 o’clock.<lb/>
            She had been somewhere out eastward during the morning. What is to be wondered at is the fact that they actually did meet to a minute! — but as Father was there a little too soon, he went to the top of the Monument (200 feet). <gap reason="overwritten"/> Well they went to the T.T. together &amp; came home all right.</p>
         
         <p>I expect to come home Xmas for a little time. Frank Lock is living in <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743">London</placeName> &amp; is coming to see me. Perhaps Shaw may come down with me for a day or two Xmas. It will be good fun, he is such a “coddle” and I paying the outing.<lb/>
            I am very economical of paper as u. may see.<lb/>
            Goodbye — Henry wrote yesterday.<lb/>
            Y. H.</p>
