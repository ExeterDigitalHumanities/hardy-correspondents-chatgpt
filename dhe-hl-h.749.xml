            <p><persName>Henry B. Amos</persName> (fl. 1910s–1930s) was Secretary of the <hi>League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports</hi>, an early British pressure group advocating legislation to ban blood sports.  
               Writing from <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743">London</placeName>, he sought statements of support from leading literary figures such as <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/49245702">Thomas Hardy</persName>.  
               Hardy, who had long expressed sympathy for animal welfare, occasionally contributed public letters or endorsements to such campaigns.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            
            <p>I presume to send you the enclosed and to ask for the favour of a brief message for our meeting on Friday.<lb/>
               The whole district, from the Vicar, leading Councillors, and most prominent women to the poorest person, is against the disgraceful act of the Hunt driving a stag over the cliffs to instant death.  
               But I want them to realise the enormity of the fact that whilst Hunts, with fifty dogs, get off for cruelties of this kind—</p>
            
            <pb facs="uoedh_hl_h.749_2.jpg"/>
            <p>the householder <unclear>is</unclear> heavily fined or sent to prison if he worries a cat or sheep with his dog.<lb/>
               You, more than any one, can say a word that will lift the whole subject into public consideration.  
               I hope it may be my privilege to help give wings to such a message.</p>
            
            <closer>
               <salute>Yours respectfully,</salute><lb/>
