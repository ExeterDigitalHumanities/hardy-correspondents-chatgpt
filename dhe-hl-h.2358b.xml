                Millicent Fawcett writes to Thomas Hardy praising *Tess*, discussing the
                moral meaning she believes fiction should convey to young readers, and
                her work assisting vulnerable girls.

            <salute>Dear Mr Hardy,</salute>
            
            <p>
                I do not expect you will remember me but I will try to recall myself to you by
                mentioning that I had the pleasure of meeting you &amp; Mrs Hardy at Lady Portsmouth’s
                London house two or three years ago.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have been very full of admiration for your *Tess* and of real gratitude to you
                for writing it, but I should<lb/>
            </p>
            
            <!-- PAGE 2 -->
            <pb facs="uoedh_hl_h.2358_2.jpg"/>
            
            <p>
                not have intended so far to tell you this which must be an old story to you.<lb/>
                My object in writing is to ask if you<lb/>
                —no one could do it half as well—<lb/>
                would write a short story within the limits of thought and language that could be
                readily comprehended by working boys &amp; girls on the shipwrecks of what ought to be the
                most beautiful thing in their lives—what comes of treating love between man &amp; woman with
                lightness and irreverence.  
            </p>
            
            <!-- PAGE 2–3 OVERLAP IMAGE -->
            <pb facs="uoedh_hl_h.2358_2-3.jpg"/>
            
            <p>
                What I want to see made plain in a story is that the very holiness &amp; beauty of the thing,
                at its best, makes any trifling with only the physical part of it result in corruption—
                “Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.”  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I work with some friends to help girls who have gone wrong to get on their feet again and
                we see so much of the utter want of apprehension that there is any high and noble side to
                this thing that they have gone shipwreck upon; it is difficult to get even a glimmer of it
                through to them, and I imagine it would be even more difficult in the case of men of the
                corresponding type.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                Could a small prose help to make it obvious that men may read?<lb/>
            </p>

                Believe me yours very faithfully,<lb/>
