          <salute>Dear <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/49245702">Mr Hardy</persName>,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I am very sorry to have to tell you that <persName>Mr George</persName> was killed on 21st inst — just as his Company was leaving the trenches to attack. I was not with the Regt. myself as I took over command of the Brigade on the 19th. His Company Commander — <persName>Captain Gregory</persName> — told me (as he was going back wounded) that George died before he could be moved into safety.<lb/>
        George had done splendidly since we started fighting on the 7th. On the 17th he distinguished himself particularly, &amp; brought great credit to the 5th Dorset Regt., by rushing a Turkish trench with his Platoon, bayonetting some 8 or 10 Turks &amp; bringing back 14 prisoners. I sent his name forward for reward &amp; it was forwarded by the Brigade.</p>
        <p>I write all this to you with the request that you will let his people know. All papers &amp; addresses of next-of-kin were lost when my Adjutant was killed on the 17th inst, otherwise I shd not trouble you. The 5th Dorsets have done splendidly, but at a great cost, as our casualties have been 21 officers &amp; over 500 men, killed, wounded, &amp; missing.</p>
        <closer>
          <salute>Believe me</salute><lb/>
          <signed>Yours sincerely,<lb/>Caldecott Hampson<lb/>(Brig.-General, 34th Inf. Brigade)</signed>
