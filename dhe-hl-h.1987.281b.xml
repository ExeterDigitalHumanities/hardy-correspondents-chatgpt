            <p>
                I suppose you are very glad that Xmas is coming. Do not send back the Sat. N<unclear>o</unclear>'s but take care of them and put them in your box, so that I may have them when I want them—
                I wish you wd tell me how u. r. when u. write. I have a <unclear>c——</unclear> “cold &amp; it is by head” so I have stayed in all day to be all right to morrow.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last Friday night there was a conversazione (pronounced Ron-ver-sat-zi-on-e)
                at the Architectural Association's rooms. There were about 300, or 400 present, including your humble servant.
                Mr Blomfield, one of the Committee, gave me a ticket, and Mr Bunker, another Committee man, another, &amp;c.
                I gave to Shaw and we went together. After lots of speechifying from learned professors, there was music &amp;c, and coffee—this last rather in small quantities.
                Many ladies were there; and of course in full dress. Shaw lent me a dress coat (thus <unclear>☞</unclear> as I did not possess one). My name was proposed amongst many others, for becoming a member…

            <p>
                only means paying 10/– a year.
                Miss A. and Father went off all right, as you know.
                Do you ever write to Eliza? Father enjoyed himself, strangely. I took them to hear the Opera of <unclear>Lurlina</unclear> at
                <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2655984/">Covent Garden</placeName>, but nothing would satisfy Father unless he went to see the Thames Tunnel.
                This, you know, is 5 or 6 miles from Kilburn, and lies in one of the lowest and most crowded parts of London.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Accordingly, one morning he started off alone, agreeing to meet Miss A. at the foot of the
                Monument on <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743/">Tower Hill</placeName> at 1 o’clock. She had been somewhere not mentioned during the morning.
                What is to be wondered at is the fact that they actually did meet; but as Father was there a little too soon,
                he went to the top of the Monument (200 feet). <unclear>———</unclear> <unclear>—— —— —— —— —— ——</unclear>
                Well, they went to the T. T. together and came home all right.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I expect to come home Xmas for a little time. Frank Lock is living in
                <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743/">London</placeName> &amp; is coming to see me.
                Perhaps Shaw may come down with me for a day or two Xmas. It will be good fun, he is such a “coddle” &amp; I paying the outing.
